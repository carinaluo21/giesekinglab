# giesekinglab
This directory contains scripts that I wrote for various purposes while conducting research in the Gieseking group at Brandeis University. 

[analyze_cube_file.py](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/blob/f7f4662c1dfc198b9056bc1296c02b19cceea7d0/analyze_cube_file.py) is a script for comparing .cub files of molecular orbitals in terms of the value of the wavefunction along the x, y, and z axes. This script was used in a project for comparing orbitals generated using a plane wave basis set to orbitals generated using a Dunning basis set.
