- The [basis_set folder](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/tree/ce17ea6676aa84d2f841baeecac07a5083d17b31/basis_set) contains scripts used to compare the structure of orbitals computed with either the aug-cc-pVDZ-PP basis set or a plane wave basis set.
- The [excited folder](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/tree/d543e81bee6b198df9738f46a1b637bd6f02de65/excited) contains scripts used to compare the computational expense and excited state energies of EOM-CCSD-based calculations.
