# giesekinglab
This directory contains scripts that I wrote for research purposes while working in the Gieseking group at Brandeis University. 

The scripts are organized into folders according to what project they were used for. 
- The [basis_set folder](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/tree/ce17ea6676aa84d2f841baeecac07a5083d17b31/basis_set) contains scripts used to compare .cub files.
- The [excited folder](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/tree/d543e81bee6b198df9738f46a1b637bd6f02de65/excited) contains scripts used to compare computational expense and excited state energies of EOM-CCSD-based calculations. 
- The [ground folder](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/tree/be68dc85765b762710d0669687a8e0603e27063b/ground) contains scripts used to extract the ground state binding energies, displacement energies, and relative isomeric energies from CCSD(T) log files.
