# giesekinglab
This directory contains scripts that I wrote for various purposes while conducting research in the Gieseking group at Brandeis University. 

[analyze_cube_file.py](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/blob/f7f4662c1dfc198b9056bc1296c02b19cceea7d0/analyze_cube_file.py) is a Python script for comparing .cub files of molecular orbitals in terms of the value of the wavefunction along the x, y, and z axes. This script was used in a project for comparing orbitals generated using a plane wave basis set to orbitals generated using a Dunning basis set. 

[relativeisomericenergy.sh](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/blob/6f5642de118aebe512a1e2de7a519cf5a151679a/relativeisomericenergy.sh) is a Bash script that converts binding energy data into relative isomeric energy data that can be later used as an input file when plotting the relative energies of structural isomers.

[plot_isom_energy.py](https://github.com/carinaluo21/giesekinglab/blob/ba3b91320d2620ddc21d3a915f389ebdbe3b052c/plot_isom_energy.py) is a Python script that plots the relative energy of structural isomers.

[bind_disp.sh]() is a Bash script that calculates binding energy and displacement energy from single-point energies and exports this data to output files upon which further operations can be performed.
